## Recommended release flow

1. Keep the release bounded to agent-role and handoff meaning.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` in the `Summary / Validation / Notes` shape.
3. Run the repo-level verifier:
   - `python scripts/release_check.py`
4. Run federation preflight:
   - `aoa release audit /srv --phase preflight --repo aoa-agents --strict --json`
5. Publish only through `aoa release publish`.
